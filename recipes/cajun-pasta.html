        <h3><em>A creamy cajun chicken pasta that is both delicious and spicy!</em></h3>
        <p>This is a recipe to create a delicious cajun chicken pasta. It can be changed to be as spicy as you want by adjusting the amount of cayenne pepper added.
            If you are looking for something with less bell pepper flavor they can be removed in order to change the dish entirely. This dish is more complex than the chicken alfredo and requires a bit more prep time.
            You will most likely want to prepare all your tools prior to starting this dish to save you time down the line and help with stress.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>12 oz penne pasta</li>
            <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup diced white onio</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, seeded and diced</li>
            <li>4 large cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tsp Cajun seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
            <li>1 tsp parprika powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp groun black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp cayenne pepper**, more or less depending on personal taste</li>
            <li>1 1/2 lbs chicken breast tenders, cut into bite size pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup parmesan cheese, freshly shredded</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>4 oz cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chicken broth</li>
        </ul>    
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil 6 cups of water in a large pot over high heat and cook the pasta according to the package directions. Drain the pasta, rinse with cold water (so it doesn't clump, can also toss a little olive oil on it to prevent clumping) and set aside.</li>
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, add the butter, olive oil and onion to a large pot over medium-high heat and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the onion becomes translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the red bell pepper, garlic, Cajun seasoning, basil, paprika, ground black pepper, salt and cayenne pepper. Stir to combine and cook for 3 more minutes or until the bell pepper starts to become soft.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken and stir and cook for another 6-8 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.</li>
            <li>Add the parmesan, heavy cream, cream cheese and chicken broth and stir and cook for 8-10 minutes or until the sauce starts to thicken and the cream cheese has fully melted.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked and drained pasta and stir to coat pasta with sauce. Cook for 2-3 minutes, then serve with freshly chopped parsley on top, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
