        <p>This is a simple recipe for a one pot chicken alfredo. It will be easy to make and is a restaurant quality dish. You simply cook the chicken, add the broth and milk, bring to a boil, and cook the noodles. It will make plenty for 4-8 guests depending on the batch size, and can be customized with shrimp, cajun spices, or any other modifications to suit your tastes.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups milk</li>
            <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 pound spaghetti (or noodle of your choice)</li>
            <li>1 pound chicken or shrimp</li>
            <li>1 TBSP Olive Oil</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>2 cups Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Salt and Peper to taste</li>
        </ul>    
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Dice the chicken to bite size pieces, then cook with the olive oil over medium heat. Add salt/pepper and season chicken to taste</li>
            <li>Once the chicken is cooked, add the chicken broth and milk and bring to a boil over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Once the broth is boiling, add the pound of noodles and lower heat to a low-medium heat. If the broth runs low and the noodles are still cooking, add more milk and broth in a 1:1 ratio. Noodles vary in cook time.</li>
            <li>After the noodles have finished cooking to desired softness, and the broth has cooked down, add the heavy whipping cream and parmesan cheese. Stir all the ingredients together and leave the heat on low.</li>
            <li>Continue stirring until the sauce is thickened and the cheese is fully mixed and melted. Enjoy!</li>
